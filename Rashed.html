    <h1> <mark>Hi!</mark> this is <span>Rashed Khan</span></h1> 
    
    <p>I am from Barguna and I also graduated from <b><i>Barguna Collegiate high School</i></b> in 2009 with Science. After that I did diploma from civil department and also did HSC. I lost a few years due to a special reason and now I am studying law in 3rd year at the "European University of Bangladesh". As well as studying I want to be a web developer. Recently I came to know about Shikhbesbai. The trainer <strong>"Farid Rony"</strong> sir  is a very good teacher. So I took admission here. Everyone will pray for me. Thanks to all.</p>
